# Minecraft Clone

This project is a simplified version of the popular game Minecraft, built using C++ and OpenGL. It includes basic features such as terrain generation, tree creation, and a rotating sun.
I would advise against downloading this and running it yourself, it is unlikely to work given that setting up OpenGL was a pain for my machine.

## Features

- **Terrain Generation**: Generates terrain using Perlin noise.
- **Tree Creation**: Procedurally generates trees in the world.
- **Vertex Shaders**: Uses advanced vertex shaders for efficient rendering.
- **Block Management**: Includes functionality to place and clear blocks in the world.
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Vertexes have different lighting depending on adjacent blocks.
- **Frustum Culling**: Custom frustum file to optimize which blocks should be considered for render.
